Changes in telescope 1.0.1: /05/11/13/

Fixed null pointer bug that caused seg. faults when stream is interrupted
added memory allocation checks
fixed "socket on non-socket operation" due to unused variable use - was causing failure to start the clients thread pool
general stability checks performed 


Changes in telescope 1.0.2: /05/19/13/

Added the daemon mode when telescope is in server mode - no need to use & in the shell any more to put the process in the background
Separated the publisher and subscriber modes - telescope now could operate in any of the modes independently
Publisher mode does not require to subscribe to the remote XML stream any more and can just serve the data file to subscribers.
addressed the password bug when connecting to port 50005 of the telescope instance running in the server mode
Reorganized the project directory structure - added src, doc, scripts directories & arranged files accordingly

Refactoring of some global variables and constants and function names for clarity
MAJOR: Shift from malloc() to static buffer approach for stream processing to avoid seg faults in the client (sub) mode caused by excessive benchmarking when XML messages are arriving too fast
