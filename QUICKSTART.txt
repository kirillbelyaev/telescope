TeleScope is the efficient intensive-load XML message stream broker written in C for the Fedora 17-18, Slackware 13-14, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL-6) Linux distributions.


####################
# WHY you need it? #
####################

The general scenario for TeleScope deployment is the need for consistent/selective replication of XML message stream from a single source publisher to multiple destinations for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) purposes. The replication is formed through establishing a network of interconnected TeleScope brokers:

1. publish/distribute remote content from remote publisher to local subscribers - all subscribers should have the same consistent replication when all subs receive all the messages in the stream (filtered at a single entry point)

2. publish/distribute remote content from remote publisher to local subscribers - all subscribers then can filter content they need (filtered at a single entry point)

3. publish/distribute local XML content to a set of subscribers - subscribers then can filter the messages they want to save


Local distribution example:

Applications are generating XML data that needs to be replicated to other applications/databases.

For example central weather application dumps continental US weather data in XML format - you need to distribute specific geographic regions covered by weather data to different nodes that then run ETL on the data. 

Run XMLConverter utility (supplied) to continuously convert XML data into TeleScope XML format ready for streaming. 

Run TeleScope to publish converted XML data to subscribers in other parts of the network segment. 
Each TeleScope subscriber filters and saves only messages relevant to itself for further ETL.

INSTALLATION

NOTE: The TeleScope system has been compiled and tested ONLY on the latest Fedora 17 - 18, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (RHEL-6) and Slackware 13.37.0 - 14.0 Linux distributions.

Prerequisites:

Development libraries including gcc and make utility,  gnome libxml2 headers (libxml2-devel)

untar the telescope-version-X.tar and cd into the project directory 
type make clean to remove stale .o files
type make all in the current project directory to compile TeleScope
the executable is installed in ./bin/telescope
copy the ./bin/telescope executable to the desired directory (typically /usr/local/bin/telescope )

Run-time Command-line options:

-s - turn on server mode
-l - turn logging on to file
-d - turn XML data file reading on to populate the Queue Table from the file - provide data file name
-h - hostname to connect to
-p - port number for the host to connect to
-f - filename to write the captured xml messages  (mandatory: name for text data ﬁle)
-e - query expression to match in the xml data stream

Example use:

Run in publisher/subscriber mode - connect to publisher and serve stream to subscribers
./bin/telescope -s - h xmlhub.com -p 8080 -f test.txt -e "type = UPDATE"
./bin/telescope -s - h xmlhub.com -p 8080 -f test.txt -e "AFI = IPV6"

become a server and publish xml messages from file:
./bin/telescope -f /dev/null -e "" -d xmldataS.txt -s &

become a subscriber to host volga on port 50000
./bin/telescope -h volga -p 50000 -f data -e "station_id = 42362" &

./scripts/telescope-stop.sh - stop TeleScope
